# ! please not there are some useless files in here to launch this website you need first to navigate to td3/test and launch backend.js from there (app.js is useless)
# and then navigate to td3/td3 and ng serve from there to get a fully functional website 

we have hard coded 2 types of cards in the database for testing the first ones are due for a later date when you open the site they are not displayed you need to wait a few days for them to show and the other set of cards are directly due therefore the moment you open the site they are displayed and can de evaluated equllay they will be shown again in 1/2 or 3 days based on the difficulty you choose if you wait they will re appear but you have to wait at least 1 dayif you chouse hard and at least 3 days if easy
